      "llm_answer": "An Euler circuit, also known as an Eulerian circuit, is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.  It's a special type of walk.  A graph possesses an Eulerian circuit if and only if all of its vertices have an even degree (number of edges connected to them).  If any vertex has an odd degree, an Eulerian circuit is impossible.\n\nThe problem of finding an Eulerian circuit originated with the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, where mathematicians struggled to determine if a walk could exist that crossed each of the seven bridges exactly once and returned to the starting point. Leonhard Euler recognized that the problem could be transformed into a more manageable form by abstracting the complex city map into a graph consisting of nodes (landmasses) and edges (bridges).  By removing the irrelevant details, he realized that the existence of an Eulerian circuit depended solely on the degrees of the nodes.\n\nEuler's abstraction\u2014representing landmasses as nodes and bridges as edges\u2014was a crucial step.  He then demonstrated that the K\u00f6nigsberg graph had four nodes with odd degrees, proving that an Eulerian circuit was impossible.  This insight led to the development of graph theory, a field that studies the properties and relationships of graphs.\n\nThe concept of degree is fundamental to understanding Eulerian circuits.  A node with an even degree can be traversed in either direction along its edges, while a node with an odd degree must be the start or end point of the circuit.  The existence of an Eulerian circuit requires either zero nodes with odd degree (a closed Eulerian circuit) or exactly two nodes with odd degree (an Eulerian path).\n\nModern network analysis relies heavily on sparse matrix representations like CSR to efficiently handle large graphs, enabling researchers to study complex systems such as social networks, transportation networks, and the internet.",
