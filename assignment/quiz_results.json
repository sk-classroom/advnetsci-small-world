      "llm_answer": "An Euler circuit, also known as an Eulerian circuit, is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.  It's a special type of walk.  A graph possesses an Eulerian circuit if and only if all of its vertices have an even degree (number of edges connected to them).  If any vertex has an odd degree, an Eulerian circuit is impossible.\n\nThe problem of finding an Eulerian circuit originated with the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, where mathematicians struggled to determine if a walk could exist that crossed each of the seven bridges exactly once and returned to the starting point. Leonhard Euler recognized that the problem could be transformed into a more manageable form by abstracting the complex city map into a graph consisting of nodes (landmasses) and edges (bridges).  By representing the problem as a graph, Euler realized that the key constraint was the degree of each node \u2013 the number of edges connected to it.\n\nEuler proved that the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem was unsolvable because all four landmasses had an odd degree.  This discovery marked a pivotal moment in the history of mathematics, as it demonstrated the power of abstraction and graph theory.  The concept of degree became a fundamental tool for analyzing networks.\n\nMore generally, an Eulerian path is a walk that visits every edge exactly once, but it doesn't have to return to the starting vertex.  An Eulerian path is possible if and only if the graph has at most two vertices with odd degree.\n\nThe use of sparse matrix representations, like CSR, is crucial for efficiently handling large networks because it avoids storing redundant information (all the zeros) and focuses only on the existing connections. This dramatically reduces memory usage and speeds up computations.",
